<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Anchor was built by 4 Junior Developers enrolled onto the Code Nation 'Master: Coding' 3 month course.

Anchor's concept was inspired by Rebecca's month long battle with pneumonia before the COVID-19 virus spread beyong Wuhan.

Pneumonia severely debilititates the human body, making it difficult to breathe and speak. Combined with intense fatigue and flu-like symptoms, it can be difficult for anyone suffering with the illness to get help.

Rebecca could not have coped without the care of her partner, who called 111 and spoke on her behalf. An ambulance was sent out. How would that situation be handled if you added quarantine into the mix? What if you were isolating from the people you lived with, to not risk them catching the virus?

Enter Anchor, an app created for desktop and mobile.

* Create a secure account with a unique password
* Read the latest news about COVID-19 and new product features on the Dashboard
* Chat with DocBot, a friendly chatbot which will log your symptoms into a Journal
* Contacts will be notified if you are experiencing extreme symptoms that require medical intervention
* View your logs in the Journal, which you can show to a medical professional to review the virus' progression
* Immediately notify a pre-registered contact that you need help via an easily accessible emergency button

A list of commonly used resources that we found helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
